# US-Economic-Data-Analysis
A look into several datsets concerning the US's economy. The full report can be located in the US_Economic_Data.ipynb file.
## Goals

> * What percentage of income growth went to each segment of the population each year? Has this changed over time?
> * Does GDP growth lead to better employment?
> * Does GDP growth lead to increases in the Consumer Price Index?
> * As labor force population has grown, has GDP grown proportionally?
> * How has the job market in the US developed over time. Are more or less people working in agriculture. Has the percentage of the population in the labor force grown or shrank?





## Conclusions

* For nearly all segments of the population, their share of the income within the economy has decreased over time. This shows that wealth has shifted more towards the top. This becomes evident when we analyze the earnings of the top 5%, which have seen a nearly 7% increase in their share of income growth over the past five decades. This dataset was only limited to the bottom earner of the top 5%, ie the 95 percentile earner. It would be interesting to see how this trend would continue with a dataset that shows the 1 percentile earner and 0.1 percentile earner.

* There is little to no correlation between GDP growth and percentage of workers who are unemployed. While the correlation is weak, it is of some note that it trends positive. Typically, we would think years that saw GDP growth would be associated with higher labor utilization, but the data implies the opposite. More in depth analyisis on this question would be necessary before a conclusion could be reached.

* When analyzing GDP and the Consumer Price Index, we see a nearly 1:1 correlation. This shows that prices directly increase to reflect the increase in GDP. While the correlation is high in a generalization of prices, it would be interesting to see how GDP growth affects prices of different goods; such as housing costs, education costs, food costs, and consumer vehicle costs.

* GDP growth appears to be rather disconnected with labor force population. Initially, it seemed to be a rather linear correlation, but as the population has leveled out we have seen the opposite of what is reflected. Instead of GDP leveling out with population, we are seeing GDP growing at faster rates than ever before. Further analysis could help us narrow down if this is only due to inflation, or if modern workers are able to "produce" at a much higher value than in previous decades.

* We found that the ratio of labor in agriculture had been on sharp decline for several decades, but then began to slow on its decrease around 1970. It appears to flatline around the 1-2% more recently. Further Analysis could help us determine if this flatline will hold as population size holds, or if we will see even smaller participation in the industry as more of it begings to be automated.

* Lastly, we find that labor participation within the population is tied heavily to the baby boomer generation. Recently, as more of them begin to retire, we see sharp declines. Will this stabilize as their generation completely leave the workforce, or is this a snapshot of what is to come?
